            This website is the product of four months of detailed research, interviewing, reporting and synthesizing. But I couldn’t do it alone.

            My biggest thanks goes to Carlene Hempel, a teaching professor at the School of Journalism and my supervising instructor for this project. She has been my greatest supporter and a brilliant mentor; I could not have completed this project without her patience, foresight and guidance and I owe many of my journalistic accomplishments to her teachings.
          </p>

            I’m grateful for Natalie Hsu, my website developer. Natalie is a PlusOne student at Northeastern University. Last year, she received her bachelor’s degree in computer science and interaction design and is currently working toward a master’s degree in information design and data visualization. She’s responsible for this beautiful website; she carefully helped me design and implement my vision for this project.
          </p>

          <p>Lastly, I would like to thank the School of Journalism as well as my family and friends for their continued support throughout not only this project but my collegiate education as a whole.</p>
