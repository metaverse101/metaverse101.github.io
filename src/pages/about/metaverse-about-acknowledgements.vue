            This website is the product of four months of detailed research, interviewing, reporting and synthesizing.
            But I couldn’t do it alone.
          </p>

          <p>
            My biggest thanks goes to Carlene Hempel, a teaching professor at the School of Journalism and my supervising
            instructor for this project. She has been my greatest supporter and a brilliant mentor; I could not have
            completed this project without her patience, foresight and guidance and I owe many of my journalistic
            accomplishments to her teachings.
          </p>

          <p>
            I’m grateful for Natalie Hsu, my website developer. Natalie is a PlusOne student at Northeastern University.
            Last year, she received her bachelor’s degree in computer science and interaction design and is currently
            working toward a master’s degree in information design and data visualization. She’s responsible for this
            beautiful website; she carefully helped me design and implement my vision for this project.
          </p>

          <p>Lastly, I would like to thank the School of Journalism as well as my family and friends for their
            continued support throughout not only this project but my collegiate education as a whole.</p>

          <p>
            I would also like to thank Sokhean Jonathan Ouk, the interim manager of the Immersive Media Lab at Northeastern
            University. He helped me imagine and implement the presentation for this project, including the virtual reality
            elements, and shared the resources to do so. Special thanks to Siddharth Singhai, a graduate student studying
            game science and design in his second year at Northeastern University who modeled the technology during the presentation.
          </p>
