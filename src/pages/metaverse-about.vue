        <p>Anyone who knows me knows I am one of the more technology-averse members of Gen Z. I don’t use social media
          unless absolutely necessary, it took me an obscenely long time to transition from CDs to iTunes to streaming
          services and I still prefer wired earphones over bluetooth ones. This begs the question, ‘Why would I spend an
          entire semester delving into the metaverse, one of the most complex technological phenomenons of our time?’</p>

        <p>I suppose I wanted to challenge myself. My favorite thing about being a journalist is that my job is to learn.
          I learn from renowned leaders and experts and tell their stories. This topic arose after a conversation with a
          friend where we disagreed on the implications of the metaverse, which made me realize how polarizing it is - even
          when it does not yet exist.</p>

        <p>I used this project to learn the ins and outs of a system I would otherwise never broach and reported it in a
          way that would help people like me understand it - from a human, rather than technical, perspective. Whether you
          enjoy technology or not, the metaverse will play a big role in your future and we all need to know more about it.</p>

        <p>Throughout this intensive process, I learned not only about the metaverse but about myself as a journalist. I
          think this project is one of my proudest achievements. Don’t get me wrong; these pieces are not going to teach
          you everything about the metaverse, nor do I believe any single piece of journalism could achieve that. But it
          will give you a foundational understanding of the concept we will continue hearing about over the next few years.</p>
        <p>Take your time; I hope you learn a little something.</p>

        <p><em>About the Project</em></p>
        <p>In the College of Arts, Media and Design at Northeastern University, the Honors in the Discipline program offers students the opportunity to complete an advanced project in an area related to their academic program, typically through a four-credit course.</p>
        <p>Beginning with a proposal and ending with a presentation for the Dean, faculty members and other students, the program participants work with a supervising faculty member to execute the project over one semester. Students who successfully complete the Honors in the Discipline program will earn an Honors credential on their official transcript.</p>
