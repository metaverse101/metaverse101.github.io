        <span class="mt-10">
          <p>
            The future of technological innovation. <br>
            The forthcoming iteration of the internet. <br>
            The next big thing.
          </p>

          <p>
            Chances are you have heard revolutionary statements as such - from flagship technology companies to your gamer
            friend - about a system that will change the world: the metaverse. Colloquially, it is a computer-generated,
            immersive environment that people can navigate and interact with, designed to mimic the real world and beyond.
            The truth, however, is far more complex.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some people believe humans will be able to live - at least part of their lives - in the metaverse, working
            and socializing as they do typically, but with more creative freedom and without the physical limitations.
            Despite the widespread reach of its spectacle, however, the metaverse itself remains enigmatic. Both expansive
            yet not fully realized, the metaverse raises many questions about its inner workings, inherent dangers and
            all-encompassing future.
          </p>

          <p>
            “I like to say that the metaverse is a metaphor,” said David Nelson, director of the Mixed Reality Lab at
            the University of Southern California. “It is a placeholder for what we will do with immersive technology,
            how we will adopt it and how it will impact our lives and our culture. People are using this term without
            it really being defined yet and I think they know that because it is being defined as we discuss it.”
          </p>

          <p>
            It is hard to say what the metaverse is. But here is what the metaverse is not: it is not a conception nor a
            product of Meta Platforms. In 2021, when Facebook <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/">rebranded</a> as Meta Platforms and announced its renewed focus
            on the metaverse, the futuristic system became popularly, solely and falsely associated with the social media company.
          </p>

          <p>
            <a href="https://www.grandviewresearch.com/industry-analysis/metaverse-market-report">According</a>  to Grand
            View Research, a global market research and consulting company based in the United States and India, the global
            metaverse market was worth approximately $38.85 billion in 2021. By 2030, it is estimated to be worth approximately
            $678.8 billion. Meta Platforms is one of several companies with a stake in the metaverse. And this is all when the
            metaverse does not even exist yet.
          </p>

          <h2>A “real” world viewed through headsets?</h2>

          <p>
            “The most recent Mark Zuckerberg iteration of the metaverse is a half-assed update of a very, very, very old idea,”
            said Ethan Zuckerman, director of the Initiative for Digital Public Infrastructure at University of Massachusetts,
            Amherst. Zuckerman has been a  <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/10/facebook-metaverse-was-always-terrible/620546/">vocal critic</a>
            of modern metaverse developments. “Those ideas have been hanging out there since the early ‘90s. A whole bunch
            of people tried building metaverses in the late 1990s, way before the technology was ready for it.”

          </p>

          <p>
            The word “metaverse” made its first appearance in “Snow Crash,” a 1992 science fiction novel by Neal Stephenson,
            describing a digital world accessed through headsets. Metaverse ideas became mainstream fictional fodder, from
            movies like “The Matrix” about humans trapped within a simulated reality, released in 1999, to “Ready Player
            One” about humans escaping the real world to a virtual one, published as a book in 2011 and released as a movie in 2018.
          </p>

          <p>
            Technology followed. 2003 saw the creation of “Second Life,” an online virtual world where people could interact
            as themselves or other custom beings in environments from a science laboratory to a movie theater. In 2014,
            Google released Google Cardboard, a virtual reality platform accessed through a cardboard viewer with lenses
            that covers the user’s eyes. By inserting a smartphone into the viewer, the device simulates virtual reality
            through compatible apps. It was followed by Facebook’s Oculus Quest, a wireless virtual reality headset that
            is immersive and panoramic, primarily used for entertainment, in 2019.
          </p>

          <p>
            Most likely, you have had some sort of interaction with some sort of iteration of the metaverse. But do you
            really understand what it is or what it could become?
          </p>

          <p>
            There is no consensual definition of the metaverse, but many point to Matthew Ball, author of the 2022 book,
            “The Metaverse: And How It Will Revolutionize Everything.” His definition reads, “A massively scaled and
            interoperable network of real-time rendered 3D virtual worlds that can be experienced synchronously and
            persistently by an effectively unlimited number of users with an individual sense of presence, and with
            continuity of data, such as identity, history, entitlements, objects, communications, and payments.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Some of those keywords are already realized through existing technology. A “virtual world,” for example, is
            a computer-generated environment - like a violent warzone or a busy restaurant - commonly present across video
            games and animated movies, in both 3D and otherwise. Moreover, most people have experienced “synchronicity,”
            to some extent, by simultaneously interacting with other people through video conferencing platforms.
          </p>

          <p>
            The metaverse does not exist because of what Ball characterizes as “massively scaled” and “interoperable.” A
            massively scaled and interoperable metaverse would house infinite virtual worlds and allow people to move
            smoothly between them. Today, some companies like Meta Platforms and Microsoft have limited virtual experiences.
            They typically require their own technology, preventing the unlimited, seamless experiences the metaverse demands.
          </p>

          <p>
            Budding metaverse experiences that meet some, but not all, of Ball’s definition can be grouped under “extended
            reality,” or XR. Extended reality is a colloquial umbrella term that includes virtual reality, augmented reality,
            mixed reality and everything in between. Experts believe extended reality experiences and technology will play
            a part in building the immersion demanded by the metaverse.
          </p>

          <p>
            Meanwhile, virtual reality is the closest to a metaverse experience, allowing people to engage in an immersive
            environment that simulates real world senses. For example, National Geographic’s Explore VR <a href="https://www.oculus.com/experiences/quest/2046607608728563/">gives</a> people the
            chance to “discover the world without ever leaving home” by climbing ice shelves in Antarctica or witnessing
            mummy worship in Machu Picchu.
          </p>

          <p>
            Augmented reality, on the other hand, superimposes computer-generated experiences onto the real world, as
            opposed to a complete immersion. These experiences are typically accessed through devices like a mobile phone
            or tablet instead of a headset. Pokémon Go is perhaps one of the most popular augmented reality experiences,
            <a href="https://pokemongolive.com/en/">facilitating</a> people to search for Pokémons by holding up their mobile phones to the real world, as if they
            were placed in specific locations.
          </p>

          <p>
            “I know that [virtual reality] and [augmented reality] are not the metaverse,” said Nelson. “However, I do think
            it is a good correlation to look at that spectrum of immersive technologies as how we will interact with the metaverse.
            There’s this spectrum of interactions with the technology and I think the metaverse will mirror that or leverage that.”
          </p>

          <h2>Wearables, an extension of the internet</h2>

          <p>
            Technology manipulates the senses to make these experiences feel real, primarily - but not exclusively - through
            virtual reality headsets and hand controllers. A virtual reality headset allows the wearer to visualize and
            interact with a 360-degree virtual experience from an active - as opposed to passive - first-person point of view.
          </p>

          <p>
            Through the display, the wearer sees and feels their surroundings change to whichever experience they choose,
            as opposed to a 2D screen where they can clearly distinguish between the virtual and real world. Headsets are
            equipped with tools like surround sound systems and head movement trackers that accordingly adjust the visualization
            of the virtual world, just as perception would change as people move around in the real world.
          </p>

          <p>
            Some advanced virtual reality headsets, like Meta Platforms’ Meta Quest Pro, even have facial tracking tools,
            allowing the natural expressions of the wearer to be reflected in their avatar. Avatars are a virtual manifestation
            of the user and the “being” they become to interact with virtual worlds. Different experiences allow for different
            levels of customizations, but many platforms typically allow the user to design their avatar to reflect their own physical traits.
          </p>

          <p>
            Many headsets are also coupled with hand controllers, which resemble joysticks. They add an additional sensory
            layer, allowing the wearer to use their hands to pick up and interact with objects in the virtual world. For
            example, a user drawing a bow and arrow in a battle field experience could feel the tension of the string
            through the controllers.
          </p>

          <p>
            From the Microsoft HoloLens to the HTC Vive Pro 2, almost every major technology company has their own virtual
            reality headset with their own experiences and specializations. They are not cheap, with price points ranging
            from $300 to $1499. <a href="https://www.counterpointresearch.com/global-xr-ar-vr-headsets-market-share/">According</a> to Counterpoint Research, a global technology market analysis company based in
            Hong Kong, Meta Platforms’ headsets accounted for 66% of the market, followed by Pico and DPVR at 11% and 9%
            respectively. Some of these headsets may be critical to accessing and navigating a fully realized metaverse.
          </p>

          <p>
            “[The metaverse is] an iterative extension of the internet,” said Nelson. “People are looking at the new
            technologies that will afford our access to it. We used to access the internet through our computers, then
            our laptops and eventually our phones. Now, we’re looking at trying to access that data through wearables
            in environments.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Regardless of present developments, some people still claim the metaverse is merely a buzzword, an attempt
            to excite an unsuspecting public, while others cite early models of budding systems that warrant a look at
            its future.
          </p>

          <p>
            “I’m in an engineering school,” said Pierre-Louis Lemaire, a master’s student studying applied mathematics
            and engineering in France. He authored and published an article on Medium, titled,, “Why The Metaverse is
            a Threat to Human Society - Not an Opportunity.” “It’s kind of interesting because a lot of people are potentially
            going to work for that type of product. Most people actually don’t talk about the metaverse. I feel like it’s
            something that we make big because it’s really controversial. But in reality, apart from people that are really
            excited for it and talk about it a lot - they make tiny amounts but [make] a lot of noise - in my circles,
            people are not that interested.”
          </p>

          <p>
            But the metaverse continues to influence a wide range of industries, from entertainment to education. Roblox,
            a virtual gaming company, <a href="https://blog.roblox.com/2021/11/introducing-roblox-community-fund/">invested</a> $10 million into developing immersive experiences for educational purposes,
            such as allowing students to virtually explore the Colosseum. Warner Music Group <a href="https://www.wmg.com/news/sandbox-partners-warner-music-group-create-music-themed-world-metaverse-36116">announced</a> a partnership with
            The Sandbox, another virtual gaming company, to create a music theme park of sorts to host virtual concert
            experiences, allowing fans and artists to engage in ways they could not in the real world.
          </p>

          <p>
            It doesn’t end there. In 2022, South Korea’s Ministry of Science and ICT <a href="https://doc.msit.go.kr/SynapDocViewServer/viewer/doc.html?key=dcc6cbad6011442e8caf03550a0e7ea7&convType=html&convLocale=ko_KR&contextPath=/SynapDocViewServer/">announced</a> an investment of ₩223.7
            billion, or approximately $168 billion, into what they call a “metaverse ecosystem,” committed to the development
            of an expanded virtual world. Countries like China and India are pursuing similar ventures.
          </p>

          <p>
            Every day, it seems like a new organization is announcing its metaverse venture, whether that is developing
            clinical training programs in immersive reality or creating computer-generated offices to boost remote work
            experiences - although all these experiences still remain isolated virtual or augmented reality experiences,
            rather than a metaverse.
          </p>

          <h2>Risks and opportunities</h2>

          <p>
            The seemingly unlimited potential of the metaverse mirrors early perceptions of the internet; both capable of
            unlocking powerful opportunities for human interaction and connection, becoming mainstays in daily life. But
            it also mirrors the dangers, which is why the metaverse continues to be a controversial subject. If what the
            future holds is a dinner with relatives from across the world in an immersive, computer-generated environment
            that feels incredibly real, it also holds risks of data privacy, technological addiction and a warped sense of reality.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Any technology we have - technology as an interface to the world - should be handled with care,” said Rob Ray,
            associate professor of design at California State University. “I think the risks are inherent no matter who
            wields those technologies, on behalf of themselves or someone else, but I think the danger from that risk is
            magnified by a corporation who is inattentive to the humans using it. Historically, the corporations who are
            currently wielding extended reality technologies have not been so careful with their humans.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Historically, humans have come to rely on technology as tools to solve some of the world’s most pressing issues,
            seemingly so crucial that the inherent risks of the technology is usually justified as long as they are relatively
            mitigated. The metaverse is no exception, with futuristic plans being discussed about how the metaverse will
            fundamentally advance critical fields like health care. Some experts warn against that mentality.
          </p>

          <p>
            “I think people who are obsessed with this idea have a sense that reality is somehow wrong and that they’d
            like to build a better version of it,” said Zuckerman. “I think maybe there are people who don’t understand
            how hard it is to build. Why is this an idea that seems to recur so often with tech people? Why are tech people
            so interested in creating an alternative reality to the one that they’re living in?”
          </p>

          <p>
            Some experts, on the other hand, urge even the most hesitant people to embrace the technology they believe is coming, whether they like it or not.
          </p>

          <p>
            “This is like [asking] our ancestors, ‘Are you for or against fire?’” said Jane Thomason, a thought leader in
            technology for social impact, based in Queensland, Australia. “Don’t be ridiculous, you can’t stop this. [The metaverse]
            is happening. Like fire, it is there, it is growing. People who go, ‘Hm, I’m not sure about this,’ they are
            so out of their league to think [the fact] they don’t approve of it is going to stop it moving forward. The
            issue that we need to be purposeful about is…how do we try and create some boundaries, some ethical principles,
            some frameworks.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Technology experts and advocates are getting ahead of the curve, since existing technology paints a detailed
            enough future of the possible pitfalls. They are encouraging safety measures within metaverse environments to
            shield against existing and forthcoming threats.
          </p>

          <p>
            2019, for example, saw the creation of the XR Safety Initiative, a global standards developing nonprofit based
            in San Francisco that promotes privacy, safety, security and ethics in immersive environments. This year, it
            is hosting its third annual Metaverse Safety Week, an international community conference bringing together
            experts and stakeholders in the technological future. These initiatives keep people hopeful for a future when
            the world can benefit from the metaverse while not capitulating to its perils in a way that heightens the human
            relationship with the real world rather than replacing it.
          </p>

          <p>
            “[It is important to help] people understand, in a balanced way, about the risks and opportunities and the potential
            social utility of the metaverse and how it actually can help us create a better, fairer and more open society,”
            said Thomason. “It’s not simple. I don’t think just because I am an optimist and I have good values and ethics
            do I think we’re going to be successful, but we need to be talking about it, educating people, working on it,
            looking for the good use cases, thinking about where the harm can come and thinking in advance about mitigating the harm.”
          </p>

          <p>
            Fully realized, the metaverse could fundamentally alter human dynamics, similar to how the internet or mobile
            phones already have, but at a greater level. Therefore, even if the metaverse is surrounded by extensive disagreement
            - and is still conceptual - most experts agree there is enough conjecture to justify public interest and understanding,
            especially if the metaverse becomes anywhere near as sweeping as some people predict it could.
          </p>

          <p>
            “Who knows? I think that’s the open question,” said Nelson. “It would be like asking Thomas Edison when he
            was building the camera, ‘What’s your favorite genre of film?’ The medium is just being born now.”
