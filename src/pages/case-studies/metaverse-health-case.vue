    <h1>A different type of healthcare: immersive, adaptive, reactive - and life changing </h1>

    <p>
      It wasn’t easy for Samantha Haspel to fight through her cancer treatment. In March 2018, the women’s health nurse
      practitioner and midwife from Salisbury, North Carolina, had been diagnosed with lymphoma and had gone through several
      unsuccessful rounds of chemotherapy. She was struggling emotionally and in a dark place. It was a chance interaction
      with virtual reality, during a routine radiation appointment, when things started to look up.
    </p>

    <p>
      “One day, I walked into the radiation lobby and they had a chair set up with a television screen, a thing of wipes,
      a headset and instructions,” said Haspel, now 45. She was receiving radiation and other treatments at the University
      of Pennsylvania. “I put it on, and it was a virtual reality meditation simulation where I was sitting at the edge
      of a dock on the water watching whatever was going on. There [were] birds, there was a sunset, there were fireflies,
      it was all kinds of stuff. The guided meditation was, ‘Take a deep breath and focus on the ducks flying across the horizon.’
      It was really talking about what I was seeing and it sucked me in. I did find it relaxing, it was just something that stuck with me.”
    </p>

    <p>
      By April 2019, Haspel was cancer-free. Virtual reality helped her trudge through her treatment and she wanted other
      patients to share her experience. In September 2019, she got married and asked her wedding guests to donate money,
      instead of buying gifts, to purchase 25 Penumbra REAL i-Series headsets for the Novant Health Wallace Cancer Institute in Salisbury.
    </p>

    <p>
      “I’ve actually gotten to speak with a few patients who have gotten to use the headsets since they’ve been put in and
      talked about the impact that it has had for them,” said Haspel. “One of the stories in particular is [about] a gentleman
      who has tongue cancer, has no family, comes in by himself for treatment. He had to come in to have tube feedings and he
      was very afraid of that,” she said. But now, he comes in, “puts on the glasses and he’s gone.”

      The promise of the immersive, computer-generated metaverse is yet to be realized, but related technology in virtual
      and augmented reality are already advancing health care. The cracks in health care are no secret; most countries still
      struggle to offer accessible and affordable services. Metaverse technology encourages innovative solutions across
      several departments, including in scientific collaboration, professional training and patient outcomes, all over the world.

    </p>

    <p>
      “The health care system everywhere is incredibly overstretched,” said Jane Thomason, a thought leader in technology
      for social impact and an international health care professional based in Queensland, Australia. “We don’t have enough
      health workers anywhere, we have this growing burden of chronic disease and similar things, which are incredibly
      expensive and creating a big burden on countries, but they’re also not amenable to the traditional health care system,
      which is built around hospital-based care. How can you use technology in the metaverse to be able to provide care differently?”
    </p>

    <p>
      According to <a href="https://www.precedenceresearch.com/metaverse-in-healthcare-market">Precedence Research</a>, a
      global market research and consulting organization based in Canada and India, the global market for health care in
      the metaverse was worth approximately $6.85 billion in 2021. By 2030, it is estimated to be worth approximately
      $72.10 billion. From <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/06/14/business/virtual-reality-autism-children-telehealth-floreo.html">using</a> controlled virtual and augmented reality to help
      children with autism understand social awareness to <a href="https://www.stanfordchildrens.org/en/about/news/releases/2017/virtual-reality-imaging-technology-makes-surgery-safer">examining</a>
      3D models of the heart and lungs to perform a difficult heart valve replacement, some of this technology is already changing lives, even in its early stage.
    </p>

    <p>
      The coronavirus pandemic emphasized the importance of global cooperation and coordinated efforts. The simplest benefit
      of extended reality technology is effective communication in an accessible immersive environment, heightened by immediately
      available data. Experts hope this technology can create more effective interactions between world health leaders in the future.
    </p>

    <p>
      “[Traditionally,] it’s one-off, it’s not ongoing,” said Thomason. She has previously worked with the World Health
      Organization, which coordinates the World Health Assembly, an annual conference between its 194 member states. “Scientific
      discovery requires ongoing collaboration and access to loads of data. If you think about the opportunity for collaboration
      in the metaverse, you can bring all of these scientists together, along with data, along with digital twins, in an immersive,
      persistent environment where they don’t just go in once a year. They could be going in as often as they like.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Metaverse technology has long been used to connect people, but unique is its use in clinical training. Given the high
      cost of traditional clinical instruction, hospitals cannot hire and train as many physicians as they need to meet the
      growing demand, which is one of the reasons there is an extensive shortage. Hospitals and technology companies across
      the world are implementing virtual and augmented reality programs to hasten the training process without compromising
      quality. According to a <a href="https://jim.bmj.com/content/55/1/S91.4.abstract?casa_token=4LVzvbBLL1gAAAAA:gWWyvmjL6s4cLCMRjpvwCRncFKfFUSrubcQ9fsU5POqa9-Q0EXBoDdPFXp6APQs63lpCcwLYCHc">study</a>
      conducted at the University of New Mexico, medical students
      experience a significantly higher knowledge gain by learning in an immersive environment compared to a 2D screen.
    </p>

    <p>
      Using this technology, physicians can also regularly and repetitively practice their diagnostic, surgical and other
      skills in an environment that doesn’t require nearly as much time, money and resources to maintain. An emergency room
      simulation with computer-generated trauma victims can help physicians practice working under pressure while virtual
      reality and interactive models allow physicians to practice routine procedures - both without risking real human lives.
    </p>

    <p>
      Housed in Boston Children’s Hospital is Immersive Design Systems, which implements immersive technology across the
      hospital. Using visualization tools like Elucis, a virtual reality platform for creating 3D medical models to view
      and interact with a patient’s anatomy, doctors there are on the cutting edge of surgical planning. They also use UbiSim,
      a virtual reality platform for training nurses, to simulate an equipped operating room and a patient. Nurses wear
      headsets and hold controllers to practice interacting with their patients, while instructors observe them through
      an iPad that mirrors the experience.
    </p>

            allowfullscreen></iframe>

    <p>
      Through UbiSim, nurses can practice managing situations which rarely occur but they must still be prepared for. The
      virtual patient can be made to exhibit the real symptoms of postpartum hemorrhage, for example, which allows nurses
      to safely practice treating the condition. The real-world alternative would be to wait for a patient with postpartum
      hemorrhage, which is rare but serious, and risk their survival because the nurses may be unprepared and inexperienced.
    </p>

    <p>
      “It’s another way for people to do their training,” said Jeffrey Jacobson, the extended reality lead of Immersive
      Design Systems. “With [virtual reality], you can’t touch anything. But you can learn tactical spatial reasoning,
      you can learn how to move in the space, how to take action on the larger scale, you can practice your teamwork,
      you can practice emotional regulation.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Most people will experience extended reality through patient care. As telemedicine became increasingly commonplace
      during the coronavirus pandemic, the benefits of improved accessibility were clear. If patients cannot physically
      travel to a hospital, for whatever reason, that does not mean they should be denied care, and the metaverse could
      help facilitate that.
    </p>

    <p>
      “If you also think about the elderly and the disabled, they can’t leave their homes,” said Thomason. “They’re going
      to be able to go into a metaverse environment, seek care. It’s time to really open up worlds for people who can’t
      leave their homes but who would like to experience different things and who suffer from isolation and so forth.”
    </p>

    <p>
      This technology is not only being used to facilitate patient care but enhance it, and it is happening all over the country.
      A psychologist in Colorado, for example, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2017/07/30/technology/virtual-reality-limbix-mental-health.html">used</a>
      a virtual reality platform to treat a patient who was experiencing acute anxiety near an intersection where they were
      in a car crash. By simulating the intersection, they could together visit the site and the patient could safely reflect
      and share their thoughts, easing into the healing process.

    </p>

    <p>
      Similarly, Neuro Rehab VR, a virtual reality rehabilitation company based in Fort Worth, Texas, focuses on using
      virtual reality to hasten recovery for various neuro, orthopedic, pediatric and geriatric conditions. The company
      believes technology takes away inhibition in the recovery process, often gamifying the exercises to both distract
      and encourage. Similar to Boston Children’s Hospital, physicians observe what their patients are seeing and doing
      through a tablet.
    </p>

    <p>
      “We’ve made all these games and activities that a clinician gets to use how they best see fit,” said Megan Christiana,
      business development manager at Neuro Rehab VR. “Once you put a patient into a virtual environment, they’re not looking
      down and seeing their leg anymore that they insist does not bend. You put them on a beach, for example, and the therapist
      can magically bend their leg the whole way. They’re distracted, they aren’t even realizing this is happening.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Christiana says patients who are actively engaged in their rehabilitation will get better results and that sentiment
      is shared across all practices. The gifts of virtual reality are enormous, but so is the size of data required for
      execution. According to RBC Capital Markets, a global investment bank based in Canada, <a href="https://www.rbccm.com/en/gib/healthcare/episode/the_healthcare_data_explosion">approximately 30% of the world’s</a>
      is generated by the health care industry. By 2025, that rate is expected to reach 36%.
    </p>

    <p>
      Already, human health data is interspersed throughout our devices, from apps that track the menstrual cycle to smart
      watches that track steps. Virtual and augmented reality technology also tracks extensive biometric and facial recognition data.
    </p>

    <p>
      “What you’re introducing with [the] metaverse is risks multiplied manyfold, because you’re going to have many, many,
      many, many more data points,” said Thomason. “You’re going to be monitoring people’s physiological reactions, connecting
      with wearables and other devices. Informed consent is going to be almost impossible to collect in the metaverse. How you
      protect people’s data, how you protect people’s privacy, is going to be harder.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Some experts, on the other hand, are not as worried about data privacy, saying companies have implemented measures
      - proactively - in anticipation of mitigating those breaches. For example, Neuro Rehab VR’s technology admittedly
      collects sizable data, but the company makes sure the patient retains full ownership. The physician cannot track
      or access the data and many health organizations treat their data the same way
    </p>

    <p>
      “I think the issues regarding privacy of data and protection of data aren’t any different within [virtual reality]
      as they are in digital health or social media,” said Robert Fine, executive director of the International Virtual
      Reality Healthcare Association, an organization comprised of technology companies, teaching hospitals, universities
      and others involved in virtual reality health care, based in Washington D.C.. “I think the same concerns and how to
      alleviate them apply. There’s nothing special about healthcare except there’s some more stringent legal requirements
      in terms of how the data is managed, ensuring the particular data cannot be linked to an individual patient.”
    </p>

    <p>
      Right now, individual hospitals and technology companies have their own unique platforms that tackle specific health
      care issues. Experts predict a future where computer-generated, immersive reality becomes quintessential to the health
      care industry is foreseeable, but it remains a ways away.
    </p>

    <p>
      “I definitely think it’s going to keep going,” said Christiana. “Especially as more and more research comes out, this
      is going to be a staple in every hospital, probably most departments. Right now, there’s a lot of companies [where]
      we each have our one thing. I [wouldn’t] be surprised if every company starts to do just a little bit more, to have
      it more all-encompassing for the entirety of the hospital system.”
