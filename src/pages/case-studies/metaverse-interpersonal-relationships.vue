        A metaverse life: opening up connection and collaboration
      </h1>

      <p>
        Technology has long connected people when they cannot physically be together - even before the coronavirus pandemic
        brought about an increased use of video conferencing platforms. As is human nature, only when it was taken away did
        people realize the value of person to person interactions, which bolstered enthusiasm for technological alternatives.
      </p>

      <p>
        A fully realized metaverse could allow people to interact in an immersive, computer-generated environment that feels
        real. Some experts believe engaging in interpersonal relationships, from significant others to workplace colleagues,
        could become commonplace in the metaverse. Family and friends who live miles away from each other could meet in the
        metaverse and wholly interact as if they were right next to each other, instead of settling for a 2D video call.

      </p>

      <p>
        “When [Meta Platforms] talks about the metaverse, they talk about it as a unified social, virtual world where everybody
        can meet and interact,” said Andrea Stevenson Won, director of the Virtual Embodiment Lab at Cornell University. When Facebook
        <a href="https://about.fb.com/news/2021/10/facebook-company-is-now-meta/">rebranded</a>  as Meta Platforms, even more people
        associated the metaverse with its social potential. “But what that leaves out is there are already a lot of different social,
        virtual worlds in which people have been having important social interactions and building community for decades.”
      </p>

      <p>
        There is a long way to go before an interoperable metaverse - where multiple virtual worlds are seamlessly connected
        - exists. Right now, as Won says, “You can’t, for example, set up your avatar in Second Life and then take it over
        and play with it in Minecraft and then use it to connect with your relatives through Facebook.” But individual virtual
        communities owned by select companies - each requiring different engagements with technology - are not new.
      </p>

      <p>
        Founded in 2003, “Second Life” was one of the first mainstream virtual worlds, primarily developed for socializing.
        Users create avatars to interact with other users and user-created content. Together, they can attend social gatherings,
        from concerts to college classes. “Second Life” does not require a headset. AltspaceVR, on the other hand, can be accessed
        through a computer or a virtual reality headset. Founded in 2013, it expands on “Second Life.” Organizations host live
        events and gatherings on the platform for people to attend virtually. Their tagline, “Be together, anywhere,” sums
        up the appeal of many of these platforms.
      </p>

      <p>
        Many virtual reality platforms rely on avatars to facilitate user interaction and engagement. Avatars are a virtual
        manifestation of the user and the “being” they become to interact with virtual worlds, including other users in those
        worlds. Different platforms allow for different levels of customization, but typically users can design their avatar
        to accurately reflect their own physicality or, if they want, be something completely different.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some headsets and hand controllers used in extended reality can even mimic the gestures and facial expressions of
        the user onto their avatar, making a more believable interaction. According to Gartner, a technology research and
        consulting company based in Connecticut, 25% of people will be <a href="https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2022-02-07-gartner-predicts-25-percent-of-people-will-spend-at-least-one-hour-per-day-in-the-metaverse-by-2026">spending</a> at least one hour per day in the metaverse
        by 2026. Customizable avatars as the virtual rendition of the user become all the more important.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Avatars tend to be cartoony and goofy,” said Won, who is also a professor of communication at Cornell University.
        “But [when] you see someone you know well and you recognize their gestures and it matches up with their voice and
        their mannerisms, even filtering through the virtual reality experience, it’s like, ‘Oh, hey. This is my buddy,’
        which is a really remarkable achievement. So, if that were someone you couldn’t see, [who] you’re normally seeing
        through a Zoom screen or on a phone, it is in some ways a richer experience. You can do more things together, you
        feel more like you’re with people you care about.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Engaging with other people through avatars in a virtual world holds importance for several communities but there
        is unique value for those who have physical disabilities. Thomas Logan, an accessibility expert, is passionate about
        working with extended reality companies to make sure their technology is inclusive toward people with physical,
        cognitive or other disabilities. For example, extended reality often requires people to physically move about in
        a space, which can be a barrier for people in wheelchairs. It is also not as easy to add closed captions in extended
        reality, which would impact people who are deaf or hard of hearing.
      </p>

      <p>
        There is still room for improvement, but Logan says extended reality can also specifically help people with physical
        disabilities, because they can create avatars that don’t necessarily need to mirror the physical disabilities they
        have in the real world. If their physical disability impacts how they are perceived in the real world, they can be
        perceived differently in the virtual world.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Being able to represent yourself exactly how you appear in the real world is one thing I believe should be supported
        and allowed in the technologies,” said Logan, who founded Equal Entry, a global technology accessibility consulting
        company based in Washington. “For some people, that’s their point of view and they want that. They’re like, ‘Hey,
        if I use a guide dog in the real world, I want to have a guide dog in [virtual reality].’ But [there’s] the other
        idea too, that you can present yourself any way that you want…you don’t know that [they] have a disability because
        they appear as however [they] choose to appear. That’s going even further into having people realize it’s just a
        physical limitation and not anything that affects cognition or actually who the person is on the inside.”

        The detailed visualization of avatars means extended reality may not only facilitate human interaction but enhance
        it, in terms of both accessibility and quality. Educational institutions and the workplace are two of the biggest
        environments for socializing. For a long time, emphasis was placed on in-person interactions, but the coronavirus
        pandemic made remote engagement not only a feasible alternative but a tool for expanding innovation and collaboration.

      <p>
        “Can we use virtual reality to improve our interactions with other people?” said Won. “When you’re dealing with
        people [who] you don’t know well or maybe even meeting for the first time if they’re remote…having that interaction
        in immersive virtual reality could potentially smooth that process of getting to know each other that might be more
        awkward on Zoom or on a phone call. There’s potential in tweaking these embodied interactions that could make people
        learn to get along and know each other better.”
      </p>

      <p>
        For that reason, education and workplaces are both growing industries for extended reality. <a href="https://www.fortunebusinessinsights.com/industry-reports/virtual-reality-in-education-market-101696">According</a>
        to Fortune Business Insights, a market research company based in India, the global market for education in virtual
        reality was worth approximately $656.6 million in 2018. By 2026, it is estimated to be worth approximately $13.1 billion.

      <p>
        Eileen McGivney is a Ph.D. candidate at Harvard University whose work focuses on how people learn in immersive,
        computer-generated environments. For example, she partnered with a high school science teacher to coordinate
        virtual reality field trips to Antarctica and the International Space Station. She observed how the students
        interacted with each other in these experiences.
      </p>

      <p>
        “It was very clear [the students] wanted this to be a shared experience with other people,” said McGivney.
        “Sometimes, they were talking to each other while they had the headsets on. They [were] in a big area where
        everybody has their own space, but they [could] all hear each other. They would shout, like, ‘Yo, I’m climbing
        this wall, I’m about to fall!’ They would ask each other what they were doing. When they took the headsets off
        and we gave them a written activity to do, it totally sucked the life out of the room.”
      </p>

      <p>
        Especially in classrooms, this technology could level the playing field in terms of the students who are more likely than others to engage in the classroom.
      </p>

      <p>
        “Does it make it easier for shy people to speak up when they [can] hide a little bit behind an avatar, does it
        even out people’s willingness to talk?” said Won. “Does it make it easier to have hard discussions? Are there ways
        in which, at least for some people, interacting in virtual spaces might be better at first? Then, we can think about
        [whether it is] possible to use these experiences that are more exciting or more engaging or feel a little more
        comfortable for people who are shy. Can we use those experiences and then take them back to the classroom and
        improve our overall in-person classroom dynamics?”
      </p>

      <p>
        Still, few people believe social experiences in the metaverse, even if fully realized, will replace the need for
        in-person experiences. Especially for younger people, considering K-12 educational experiences and early career
        beginnings, the value of in-person experiences has been proved.
      </p>

      <p>
        But the similarities between extended reality platforms and social media platforms are strong, which begs concerns
        about an addiction to extended reality the same way social media addiction is a continuous problem. Just like social
        media, people can create and interact as versions of themselves that don’t necessarily represent who they really are,
        they can live and observe lives that are not necessarily accurately reflective of the real world, leading to an
        altered sense of reality and identity - only heightened by the immersive environment.
      </p>

      <p>
        “We need to think, always, about how experiences in virtual reality can enhance our experiences in the physical
        world and not how they can replace them,” said Won. “When people talk about, ‘You can do everything you do in real
        life in the metaverse,’ that’s fine. But it would be a very sad world if we were spending 10 hours a day in a headset.
        I think that would be terrible.”
      </p>

      <p>
        The consensus among many experts seems to be that immersive technology will augment and enhance the real world,
        rather than completely replace it. They believe it can open up a different perspective to human life.
      </p>

      <p>
        “I also think that virtual reality can be a good tool for self reflection,” said Won. “It’s such an unusual experience
        that it can feel really profound to reflect on embodiment and the nature of proximity and how we represent ourselves.
        I think I’m excited about its potential to enhance how we think about how we are in the physical world, the choice
        we make about how we present ourselves, how we interact with our environment, how we interact with other people.
        It’s a unique opportunity to prompt some self reflection. My hope is we can think of ways this can make us better
        interpersonally in the physical world.”
