          The immersive, computer-generated world of the metaverse lends itself well to the fantastical nature of gaming.
          People venture into video games to experience what they cannot in real life, like fighting off zombies during
          an apocalypse or adventurous space travel. That is also why many people primarily associate the metaverse with gaming.
        </p>

        <p>
          Games in extended reality have evolved to not only include creative leniencies but digital commerce and social
          interaction. In recent times, however, entertainment in metaverse environments has grown beyond gaming experiences
          to also include live events and other artistic ventures that bring people together in ways they could not otherwise.
        </p>

        <p>
          “As far as entertainment goes, [it] makes an excellent driver,” said Dan Novy, professor of emerging media arts
          at University of Nebraska-Lincoln. “It’s a really good forcing function for these kinds of things.”
        </p>

          With a headset, hand controllers and some space to move about in, people have been playing virtual reality games
          from their homes for years. These games have only become more popular, their content running the gamut. Created
          in 2019, “Beat Saber” is a rhythm game in a neon environment where users slice blocks representing musical beats
          with a pair of colored sabers. “L.A. Noire: The VR Case Files,” created in 2018, is a detective game. Users become
          Detective Cole Phelps in the game and solve crimes and conspiracies. Many of these were adapted - either literally
          or conceptually - from 2D games commonly played on phones or computers.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Me and my roommates, we got into ‘Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes,’ which is a little different from normal [virtual reality],”
          said Gabrielle Aidan, president of the Northeastern University virtual reality club. “You have a person who is reading
          you the bomb manual in real life and they’re trying to help the person who is in [virtual reality] decode a bomb. The way
          the game works is, the person who is playing in real life can’t see what the person in virtual reality is seeing. So, it’s
          really the back and forth communication of trying to decode the bomb and the high stress. It just makes for a fun game that
          you can play over and over again. It doesn’t become a wall where you’re just closing in on yourself. It becomes a connection between two people.”
        </p>

        <p>
          The headsets and hand controllers used to engage with these experiences can be expensive, with price points ranging
          from $300 to $1,499. However, the games themselves are relatively affordable - some even come free along with purchases
          from specific companies. “Beat Saber,” for example, costs $29.99 on the Oculus Rift headset, while “Keep Talking and Nobody
          Explodes” costs $14.99 on the Meta Quest Pro.
        </p>

        <p>
          Another growing focus in extended reality is developing the production tools for media experiences in metaverse
          environments, such as movies and concerts. Volumetric video is one of those tools, as it captures a three-dimensional
          space in real time. In production, it is often combined with the interactivity of virtual reality, focusing on creating
          an immersive experience.
        </p>

        <p>
          For example, in 2018, volumetric video was used to create the “Imogen Heap Holographic Show,” which was a
          first-of-its-kind immersive music performance by British artist Imogen Heap. The concert transports viewers to
          Imogen’s home studio in London. “Fireflies of Brownsville” is a volumetric video documentary about the ongoing
          rivalry between public housing developments in Brooklyn. In this experience, viewers can navigate and interact
          with parts of the neighborhood to explore the issue for themselves.
        </p>

        <p>
          “What volumetric video production does is it allows you to capture human performance as a three-dimensional
          moving photocopy,” said Ewan Johnson, founder of Arcturus, a company that specializes in volumetric video production
          tools. “Unlike motion capture or animation, there’s no simulation. There’s no artist between the person and the
          3D representation. I saw it as a really key area; moving into these spatial platforms is the only way that we’re
          going to be able to really authentically capture a performance.
        </p>

        <p>
          Other popular virtual reality experiences include all kinds of sports. In 2021, Cody Woputz, an expert in virtual
          reality with experience at several different technology companies, founded ThrowbackVR, a social- and multiplayer-focused
          gaming platform that leveraged nostalgia.
        </p>

        <p>
          “Throwback really started as sort of a gap in the market that my co-founder, Jordan, and I saw, which was that
          there’s not a lot of simple, nostalgic content in [virtual reality] right now,” said Woputz. “You look at some
          of the trends on TikTok and there were a lot of nostalgia-fueled communities. We took that and said, ‘Well, can
          we turn that into a 3D digital space, can we use the power of virtual reality?’”
        </p>

        <p>
          Recently, they created a virtual reality baseball game called “Derby,” now available on SideQuestVR, a platform
          that supports virtual reality experiences in their early stages. ThrowbackVR wanted to prioritize connection.
          They took a simple game and used immersive reality to allow people to play the sport with others they may not
          be physically close to.
        </p>

        <p>
          “I think what we’re trying to do is replicate [baseball] in virtual reality as something that is a little bit
          more slow, a little bit more casual and could let you play baseball in a way that, you know, I can’t in a homerun
          in real life, but I can in our game,” said Woputz. “So, that’s fun.”
        </p>

        <p>
          What is relatively new, on the other hand, are the growing physical locations - all over the country - dedicated
          to these kinds of technologies that people can visit to engage in virtual reality experiences. VR World NYC is a
          comprehensive virtual reality amusement center in Manhattan that offers different experiences in art, film and gaming.
          Sandbox VR is a similar national center, with locations in California, Indiana, Minnesota and elsewhere.
        </p>

        <p>
          Boston’s Key to Amaze VR is one of those centers. Founded in 2019, Key to Amaze VR allows up to 12 people to
          assume avatars and simultaneously engage in a variety of virtual reality experiences in futuristic environments.
          From a competitive paintball-like game called “Tower Tag” to “OpenBrush,” which allows users to create all kinds
          of art, the center hopes to welcome people who may not have much experience with virtual reality into its boundless opportunities.
        </p>

        <p>
          “We know this is something that is special, it’s not an individual experience,” said William Ferraro, CEO of Key
          to Amaze VR. “It can connect people, it’s a great way to connect people.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Key to Amaze VR facilitates their virtual reality experiences with the HTC Vive Pro headsets, complete with spatial
          sound headphones and accompanying wireless handheld controllers. The equipment creates a truly immersive experience
          compared to a 2D screen. For example, if a user was drawing a bow and arrow playing “Elvin Assassin,” not only does
          the headset put them right in the environment, but their controllers vibrate with tension as they pull the string back.
        </p>

        <p>
          “You feel completely immersed in the experience to the point where we get a lot of people trying to lean on walls
          that aren’t really there, put their hands on banisters, things like that,” said Nadew Mezgebu, CTO of Key to Amaze VR.
          “We get people trying to run away from zombies. I’m not sure why it is, but there’s certain people that completely fall
          for it, completely believe the idea that there’s a zombie in front of you and you have to protect yourself. Some people
          are aware that it’s a different type of experience, and some people just completely believe it.”
        </p>

        <p>
          The benefit of physical locations like Key to Amaze VR - over playing games from home - will always be the larger
          spaces they can use to facilitate their games. Many virtual reality experiences, although they require only a
          few pieces of technology, require a large amount of space to use and move about in, which is why they might not
          be as mainstream as 2D entertainment. Additionally, it is unlikely that people will enjoy wearing headsets for
          extended periods of time to engage in different experiences.
        </p>

        <p>
          “I know a lot of my friends who were early, early adopters of this wave of virtual reality ended up like, ‘I’m
          going to get rid of all the furniture in my living room,’ and basically they have this big bare space, because
          that’s what they need to do,” said Novy. “Most people are not going to be willing to do that. The claim with
          [virtual reality] or the metaverse is that you’re going to put on a headset or something and you’re going to
          have this infinite space. But in reality, you’re now requiring even more space. You want the experience to be
          as quick and comfortable and fluid as sitting down and turning on Netflix and finding something you want to watch.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Of course, it is not all fun and games. Concerns about addictions to video games have been around for a long
          time and are only heightened in the context of immersive reality. Many of these games are marketed toward children
          - such as cooking and space travel games that have already been popular among younger age groups - which increases
          risks of addiction.
        </p>

        <p>
          “I think it’s like any other medium,” said Novy. “It’s going to require parental guidance. How much screen time
          do you allow your child, what do they learn while they’re in there? What are the experiences they’re allowed to
          [have]? As a parent, you’re going to be responsible for the experiences that your child could be having in these
          kinds of virtual spaces.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Regardless of age, however, experts do believe an excessive exposure to virtual reality games can leave an impact
          on the users psychology. With the development of immersive technology, these are powerful mediums and experts emphasize
          the importance of staying connected to the real world.
        </p>

        <p>
          “What it can lead to is alienation, disassociation and lack of empathy,” said Novy. “If you’re spending most of
          your time with virtual characters, you’re not learning to empathize with them, especially in some of the more
          violent games. It’s as important for artists creating these games to create experiences that also require empathy
          to win the game.”
        </p>

        <p>
          Although it is important for entertainment experiences to be handled with care, experts like Novy do encourage
          people to embrace the creative power of immersive reality rather than solely focusing on its potential downsides.
        </p>

        <p>
          “You have to remember that everyone has made these exact same claims about pretty much every form of entertainment
          or storytelling technology,” said Novy. “People thought novels were going to cause people to go insane. It’s a
          new technology…the people are going to adopt it or not adopt it or partially adopt it and they will retain what
          is useful and they will reject what is not useful. Very much like novels and theater and recorded media and movies
          did not destroy the children of America, we do not have to concretely worry about that with any kind of metaverse
          or virtual reality.”
